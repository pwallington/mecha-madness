Mecha Madness is a multiplayer board game based on the gameplay mechanics of Robo-Rally.

Implemented in Java, the primary aims of the project are to produce a lightweight, multi-platform app, with simple networking support that implements the full set of game mechanics.

Multi-platform (in my mind at least!) initially means Windows + Mac + Linux. Java provides a nice base to work from in this respect.

If the project is a success, then future development may include a dedicated/standalone server option, and a central 'server finder' service.
